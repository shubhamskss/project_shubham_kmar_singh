              Chandramukhi 2 (transl.â€‰Moon faced girl 2) is a 2023 Indian Tamil-language comedy horror film written and
              directed by P. Vasu, and produced by Subaskaran Allirajah under the banner of Lyca Productions. It is a
              sequel to Chandramukhi (2005). The film stars Raghava Lawrence in dual roles alongside Kangana Ranaut and
              Lakshmi Menon in the principal roles along with an ensemble supporting cast, that includes Vadivelu who
              reprises his role from the predecessor, Radhika Sarathkumar, Mahima Nambiar, Srushti Dange, Rao Ramesh,
              Subiksha Krishnan, Suresh Chandra Menon, Ravi Mariya, Vignesh, and Y. G. Mahendran in pivotal roles.
              The film was officially announced in 2020 with Sun Pictures producing, though by June 2022 Lyca had taken
              over production. Principal photography began in that July, and wrapped by mid-August 2023. The music is
              composed by M. M. Keeravani, while the cinematography and editing are handled by R. D. Rajasekhar and
              Anthony, respectively. Chandramukhi 2 was released on 28 September 2023 to negative reviews from critics,
              and emerged as major commercial failure.
